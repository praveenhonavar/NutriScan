# NutriScan


A mobile application developed in flutter to keep track of daily calorie needs.

- This application uses [FirebasesMLVision](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ml-kit) to determine the food item from the picture which can be taken from the phone camera or can be selected from the gallery.

- The JSON response recieved from the ML Vision API containing the name of food item is referenced with the [Food API](https://api.nal.usda.gov/fdc) d.atabse to get nutritional facts.
